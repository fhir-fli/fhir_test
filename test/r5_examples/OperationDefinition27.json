If the server has or can create documents that are related to the patient, and that are available for the given user, the server returns the DocumentReference resources needed to support the records.  The principle intended use for this operation is to provide a provider or patient with access to their available document information. \n\n This operation is *different* from a search by patient and type and date range because: \n\n 1. It is used to request a server to *generate* a document based on the specified parameters. \n\n 1. If no parameters are specified, the server SHALL return a DocumentReference to the patient's most current CCD \n\n 1. If the server cannot *generate* a document based on the specified parameters, the operation will return an empty search bundle. \n\n This operation is the *same* as a FHIR RESTful search by patient, type and date range because: \n\n 1.
