E.g. it\u0027s possible to have multiple contacts with rank\u003d1.  If the ranks have different systems or uses, this would be interpreted to mean \"X is my most preferred phone number, Y is my most preferred email address\" or \"X is my preferred home email and Y is my preferred work email\".  If the system and use for equally-ranked contacts are the same, then the level of preference is equivalent for both repetitions. \n\nRanks need not be sequential and not all repetitions must have a rank.  For example, it\u0027s possible to have 4 contacts with ranks of 2, 5 and two with no rank specified.  That would be interpreted to mean the first is preferred over the second and no preference stated for the remaining contacts.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"ContactPoint.rank","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"positiveInt"}],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"v2","map":"n/a"},{"identity":"rim","map":"n/a"}]}]}}
