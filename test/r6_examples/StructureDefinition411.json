Typically, this is used for status, negation and qualification codes. The effect of this is that the element cannot be ignored by systems: they SHALL either recognize the element and process it, and/or a pre-determination has been made that it is not relevant to their particular system. When used on the root element in an extension definition, this indicates whether or not the extension is a modifier extension.","comment":"Only the definition of an element can set IsModifier true - either the specification itself or where an extension is originally defined. Once set, it cannot be changed in derived profiles (except in the special case of the defining a new extension). An element/extension that has isModifier\u003dtrue SHOULD also have a minimum cardinality of 1, so that there is no lack of clarity about what to do if it is missing. If it can be missing, the definition SHALL make the meaning of a missing element clear.","requirements":"Allows elements to be introduced into a specification that can\u0027t safely be ignored by applications that don\u0027t recognize them.","min":0,"max":"1","base":{"path":"ElementDefinition.isModifier","min":0,"max":"1"},"type":[{"code":"boolean"}],"meaningWhenMissing":"An element is not a modifier element unless it is explicitly specified to be one","condition":["eld-18"],"isModifier":false,"isSummary":true,"mapping":[{"identity":"rim","map":"N/A (MIF territory)"},{"identity":"iso11179","map":"??"}]}]}}
